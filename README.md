# spring-boot-todo-app
We are building a Todo manager. In our application, users can create, update,
view and delete various Todo items.

**To build our Todo application, we will use the following technologies/tools**:-
1. Spring Boot
2. H2 In-memory database
3. Spring Data JPA
4. BootStrap
5. Thymeleaf
6. Spring Tool Suite (STS)
<p>
  After all the configurations, the project has been given a little touch of Spring Security, so each time we restart the
  application, Spring generates a new password for us in the CLI.
